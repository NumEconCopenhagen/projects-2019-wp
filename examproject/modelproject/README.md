# Modelproject

In this project we seek to investigate Cournot competition and find the equilibrium output and profits. We extend our model in the second part by looking at collusion for two firms and look at different discount factors to see when collusion can be sustained.

The way to run our code is to import scipy and from scipy import optimize and arrange, import sympy, numpy to use arrays, matplotlib to create figures and pandas.

We first solve the model analytically, afterwards we solve it numerically and in the last part we extend our model to look at collusion.
